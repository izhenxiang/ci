- move to python3
- grab minimum OS version from app bundle and use when building pkg
- identify shell scripts and build a payload free package
    - problems with this:
    - how to determine if the given file is a script? executable bit? parse the #! ?
    - how to choose id and version? (for true payload free packages, this may not matter since they don't leave a receipt anyway?)
- use some preference setting to determine default package name syntax
- support for tar, gzip and bzip
? other possible file formats: prefpanes, Safari extensions?
? identify app just by name or id (could use: mdfind "kMDItemKind == 'Application' && kMDItemDisplayName == 'iTunes'")
? identify mobileconfigs and build a package installer if make-profile-pkg is present
